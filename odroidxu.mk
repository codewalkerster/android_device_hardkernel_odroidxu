# This file is the build configuration for a full Android
# build for smdk5410 hardware. This cleanly combines a set of
# device-specific aspects (drivers) with a device-agnostic
# product configuration (apps). Except for a few implementation
# details, it only fundamentally contains two inherit-product
# lines, full and smdk5410, hence its name.
